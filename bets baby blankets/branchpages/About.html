      <p>
Bets Baby Blankets started when our founder decided she would repair her partner's old baby blanket as a gift.
This sparked a passion for crafting which has grown day by day.

Now more than two years on, Bets Baby Blankets works to create unique blankets, pillows, bunting, and more, specially made
with delicate baby skin in mind.

We never stop looking for new and exciting fabric designs and styles, using seasons, festivities, culture, and trends to inspire
our designs.

All our blankets are made using high quality cotton fabrics and threads, with hypoallergenic wadding.
For easy care every item is machine washable, so no need to fear messy playtime with your little one,
simply pop in the wash at 30 degrees!
